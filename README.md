# Mouse Gene Ontology enrichment analysis pipeline
This repository represents a bioinformatic pipeline to carry Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for low and high divergence genes among two house mouse subspecies. The pipeline is used as an exercise at the course on UNIX and work with genomic data.

## Description of the pipeline

* Cleaning VCF file
* Selecting diverging SNPs
* Select SNPs from within genes
* Calculate number of divergent sites per gene
* Associate genes with GO annotation
* Calculate GO enrichment by degree of divergence
